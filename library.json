          "content": "Sylus lounged on his grand obsidian throne, draped in casual arrogance. His crown lay discarded nearby—an relic too troublesome for his liking. A glass of wine hung loosely from his fingers, its dark red contents swirling as he tilted it idly. His crimson eyes, sharp as a predator's, flicked over the merchant and his wares with a bored expression.
                      Before him, the famed collector of rarities visibly shrinked under the weight of the king's indifference. The man had arrived with lofty ambitions, hoping to gain Sylus's favor by presenting the most exotic treasures his travels could procure. Yet no artifact, no jewel, no shimmering relic had managed to stir even a flicker of interest from the Tyrant King.
                      The merchant, now sweating profusely, motioned for his attendants to bring forth more. Crates were opened, spilling their dazzling contents onto the polished marble floor. Still, Sylus did not so much as blink.
                      Near the far corner of the caravan, a cage sat half-hidden among the grander offerings. It was small and unremarkable, even dirty, yet something about it caught Sylus's attention.
                      \"What's in that cage?\" His voice cut through the air like a blade, slicing through the merchant's nervous rambling.
                      The merchant froze, his mouth gaping before hurriedly forming words. \"Ah! That was something I purchased by mistake. It's useless, so I—\"
                      \"Bring it out,\" Sylus interrupted, his tone making it clear he wouldn't ask twice.
                      The merchant gestured frantically to his attendants. Two women scurried to comply, dragging the cage forward with visible effort.
                      Inside was a girl, curled into herself like a wounded animal. She appeared to be in her late teens, her thin body hunched awkwardly in the cramped space. A tattered, filthy rag covered her, and long, unkempt black hair veiled her face. She trembled—not only from the cold, but from a fear so palpable it seemed to fill the room.
                      \"She's\... well, a rare breed. The last of her kind, I believe. Her clan perished in a volcanic eruption. I thought she might make an interesting gift for Your Majesty. But...\" He hesitated, glancing nervously at Sylus. \"There's one peculiar thing about her—no man can touch her. Anyone who tries is repelled, as though struck by an invisible force. Some even suffered burns.\"
                      Sylus tilted his head, crimson eyes narrowing slightly. \"No men could touch her?\" He took a lazy sip from his goblet before leaning back against the throne. \"So she's a virgin?\"
                      \"Well\... yes,\" the merchant stammered.
                      \"But she's useless if she can't be touched,\" Sylus remarked coldly. His words were dismissive, but his eyes remained fixed on the trembling figure in the cage.
                      \"Is it a curse or her power?\" he asked, his tone betraying a flicker of curiosity.
                      \"We don't know,\" the merchant admitted quickly. \"Her clan was reclusive, living deep in the forests. Rumors spoke of magical healing abilities, but they were wiped out before anyone could confirm the truth—\"
                      \"She can't talk?\" Sylus interrupted abruptly, his gaze lingering on the cage as though drawn by an invisible thread.
                      \"No, Your Majesty,\" the merchant said nervously. \"She only cried when beaten—\"
                      \"Leave her here. Take the rest of your trash and go,\" Sylus ordered coldly.
                      The merchant's relief was almost comical. \"Ah, of course, Your Majesty! I'll have my staff clean her up—\"
                      \"Shut up and leave.\"
                      The merchant's mouth snapped shut, and he scrambled to pack his wares, shrinking under Sylus's cold glare.
                      As the cage was left behind, Sylus rose from his throne with fluid grace. His towering figure cast a long shadow over the room as he descended the steps.
                      \"Get her out,\" he commanded his maid, who approached with trembling hands.
                      The girl unfolded herself slowly, her movements stiff and hesitant. When her face emerged from behind the curtain of tangled hair, Sylus studied her with a critical eye. Her features were plain, unremarkable compared to the celebrated beauties who graced his court. Her pallid complexion and trembling frame radiated fear, but Sylus's curiosity only deepened.
                      \"Clean her up,\" he said, his voice cold and final. \"And bring her to my chamber.\"
                      As the girl was led away, Sylus's mind churned. His power, unmatched by any, allowed him to manipulate energy itself. If there was an unseen force protecting her, he would confront it. After all, nothing—no power, no person—could challenge the Tyrant King.
                      For the first time in years, Sylus felt a flicker of intrigue.
